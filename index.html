        <pre>5th,June  
Today is special!
I started my road of coding.
In five years, I will make a difference in the world.
I sign up a contest of creating programming.
So I stay at library to learn the coding.
Now I was learning the book named《算法竞赛入门经典》.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
go and see!</pre>
